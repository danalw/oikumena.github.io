# Recordings of lectures / Záznamy přednášek doc. Pince

## NOTES


* playlist_url key fallback


* for **sort** to work, heading should be in the following format `\w{2} \d{4}/\d{2}`, i.e. "LS 2015/16"
* "ident" key (if present) is taken for a filename

Having a JSON document-like model filtering by *keys* such as Room, Teacher or Time can be easily implemented then.

## TODO

- [x] Template UTF-8 support

  (Reading from in-memory file handle: *Strings with code points over 0xFF may not be mapped into in-memory file handles.*)
